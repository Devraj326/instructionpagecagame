            Minesweeper is a classic computer game that involves clearing a grid of hidden mines without detonating any of them. Here are the basic instructions for playing Minesweeper: <br>
            <br>
            Objective: <br>
            The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the empty squares on the grid without hitting any mines.
            <br><br>
            Gameplay: <br>
            <br>
            1. To start, click on any square on the grid. This will uncover the clicked square and reveal a number or mine underneath.
            <br>
            2. If the revealed square is blank, it means there are no mines in the adjacent squares.
            <br>
            3. If the revealed square has a number, it indicates the number of mines in the surrounding eight squares.
            <br>
            4. Use the numbers to deduce the locations of mines. 
            <br>
            5. If a square has a number 'n,' it means there are 'n' mines in the eight surrounding squares.
            <br>
            6. If you suspect a square contains a mine, you can mark it with a flag to avoid accidentally clicking on it. Right-click on a square to place a flag, and right-click again to remove the flag.
            <br>
            7. Continue uncovering squares and marking mines until you have uncovered all the safe squares or until you accidentally click on a mine.
            <br><br>
            Winning: <br>
            You win the game when you successfully uncover all the safe squares without detonating any mines.
            <br><br>
            Losing: <br>
            You lose the game if you click on a square containing a mine. In this case, all the mines on the grid are revealed, and the game ends.
